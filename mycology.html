<title>Mycology</title>
<h1>Concept of Mycology </h1>
 <p>To acquire more knowledge in the field of mycology,
 specifically fungal pathogenesis and to stay connected
 with academics, I started my Ph.D. in Professor. Dr. Reinhard
 Fischer group at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).
 My Ph.D. thesis work focused on understanding the mechanism of
 light responses in the plant pathogen A. alternata. A. alternata
 <b>is a black spore producing fungus capable of producing over 
70 classes of toxins harmful to human health</b>. I investigated 
the role of<a href="https://www.google.com"target="_blank"> the red (FphA) and blue (LreA)</a> light photoreceptors
 and the interplay with the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG)
 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. Loss- of
 function mutations for fphA, lreA, and hogA were created
 using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Part of the findings of 
this study, which has been published in mBio, showed that
 high-osmolarity sensing required FphA and LreA, suggesting
 a complex cross talk between light and stress signaling.</p>

I read some of your research articles, and the area of research being pursued in your group is very interesting. Your recent publication on XXX caught my attention and I will appreciate an opportunity to discuss<b><u><i> potential research</u></i></b> ideas that align with your area of interest
<br>
<p>,I am confident that my investigative qualities, independence, creativity, and critical thinking, my technical skills in nucleic acid isolation and manipulation, qRT-PCR, protein localization, protein-protein interactions, stress assays and my experience in cell biology and microbial pathogenesis would be an asset to your laboratory</p>
